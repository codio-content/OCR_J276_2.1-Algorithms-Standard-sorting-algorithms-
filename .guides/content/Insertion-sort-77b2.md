The insertion sort algorithm examines each item in turn and inserts it in its correct position.
Only one pass is needed.

Here is the insertion sort algorithm:

1. Starting with the second item in the list compare it with all those to the left
1. When a smaller item is found place the sort item to the right of it and move the larger items to the right
1. Continue until the end of the list

The following is a list of items to be sorted into ascending order.
